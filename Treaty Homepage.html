    <h2>📜 Treaty 1: A Promise Between Two Nations </h2>
    <p>A long, long time ago, before Canada was even a country, Indigenous Peoples lived all across the land.
      They had their own homes, languages, cultures, and traditions.
      The land provided everything they needed — food, water, shelter, and medicine. 
<br>
<br>
      But in the 1800s, new people, called settlers, started arriving from across the ocean.
      They came from Britain and other countries. These settlers wanted to build homes, farms, and towns on the land. 
<br>
<br>
      The British Queen, who ruled Canada at the time, wanted to make an agreement with the First Nations so that settlers could live on the land peacefully.
      This agreement became known as Treaty 1 and it was the first of many treaties made in Canada.</p>

    <h2>📍 When and Where Did Treaty 1 Happen?</h2>
    <p>On August 3, 1871, a very important meeting took place at a place called Lower Fort Garry, also known as the Stone Fort. <em>(That's in Manitoba!)</em>
<br>
<br>
      The Queen’s helpers, called commissioners, met with the leaders of the Anishinaabe <em>(Ojibwe)</em> and Nehethowuk <em>(Cree)</em> Nations. 
<br>
<br>
      At this meeting, the First Nations and the Queen’s representatives talked about how they could live together and share the land. They wanted to make sure that everyone would be treated fairly. 
<br>
<br>
      This meeting was very important because it would change the future forever.</p>
