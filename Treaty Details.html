    <h2>What is a Treaty?</h2>
    <p>A treaty is a special kind of agreement or promise between two groups of people.
      It is written down so that everyone remembers what was said and agreed upon. 
<br>
<br>
      Treaties are meant to last forever. That means the promises made in Treaty 1 were not just for the people back then but for future generations too! </p>

    <h2>What Did the First Nations Promise?</h2>
    <p>The First Nations leaders agreed to share the land with the Queen and her people. 
<br>
<br>
      For thousands of years, the First Nations had lived on the land. They hunted, fished, and traveled freely.
      But they did not believe that land could be owned. 
<br>
<br>
      Instead, they believed that land was like air or water—something that belonged to everyone and should be taken care of. 
<br>
<br>
      Even though they agreed to share the land, they never gave it away completely.
      They expected the Queen’s people to keep their promises and treat them with respect.</p>

    <h2>What Did the Queen Promise?</h2>
    <p>In return for sharing the land, the Queen made many promises to the First Nations people.
      These promises included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>👣 Land for First Nations – Reserves
<br>
        <em>(The Queen promised that First Nations families would have their own land to live on.
          These special pieces of land are called reserves. 
          Each family was supposed to get 160 acres of land to farm, hunt, and live on.
          This land was meant to be just for First Nations people.)
        </em>
      </li>
<br>
      <li>🛖 Money and Gifts Every Year</li>
      <em>(The Queen agreed to give money and supplies to First Nations families every year. 
        Each family of five people would get $15 a year, which was a lot of money at the time!
        She also promised to give First Nations people blankets, clothes, tools, and other supplies to help them.)
      </em>
<br>
<br>
      <li>🎒 Schools for First Nations Children</li>
      <em>(The Queen promised that schools would be built on reserves so that First Nations children could learn.
        This was meant to help children learn new things while still keeping their traditions and languages.)
      </em>
<br>
<br>
      <li>🛠️ Peace and Friendship</li>
      <em>(Both sides agreed to live in peace and help each other. 
        The First Nations leaders promised to be friendly to the settlers and not harm them. 
        The Queen promised to treat the First Nations people with kindness and respect.)
      </em>
    </ul>

  <h2>Why Was Treaty 1 Important?</h2>
  <p>Treaty 1 was the first treaty signed in Manitoba, and it was one of the first treaties in Western Canada. 
    The treaty was supposed to help everyone, but after it was signed, many of the Queen’s promises were not kept.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some First Nations people didn’t get the money and supplies they were supposed to get.</li>
<br>
<br>
    <li>The schools that were promised did not always help First Nations children.
      Instead, many children were sent to residential schools, where they were not allowed to speak their own languages or follow their traditions.</li>
<br>
<br>
    <li>Settlers kept taking more and more land without asking permission.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This was very unfair, and it caused a lot of problems for First Nations families.</p>
